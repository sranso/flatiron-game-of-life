One of the projects you can choose from this week is called the game of life

This is a classic problem you can do in any programming language.

This is a good tutorial on game of life and how to use the Gosu gem to create a visualization of your game of life

This is a great project to practice TDD on although it will be hard until we cover mocking and stubbing (advanced testing techniques)

Here's a great screencast by Ryan Bigg on how to do the game of life using TDD (although he never finished it)
Note: He uses some advanced testing techniques we have not yet covered but will this week.

I used sinatra to make a web based version but you do not need to do this although it will run nicely into our discussion of sinatra next week.
